# Fashion-MNIST-Generative-Adversarial-Network-GAN-
This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using the Fashion MNIST dataset to generate synthetic fashion item images. The goal is to create a neural network that can generate new, artificial images that closely resemble the training data.
