Detailed Project Report: Fashion MNIST Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
1. Project Overview
This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using the Fashion MNIST dataset to generate synthetic fashion item images. The goal is to create a neural network that can generate new, artificial images that closely resemble the training data.
2. Conceptual Deep Dive
2.1 Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
A GAN is a machine learning framework consisting of two neural networks competing against each other:
Generator: Creates fake images
Discriminator: Tries to distinguish between real and fake images
The architecture is inspired by a game-theoretic scenario where two players (generator and discriminator) are in a continuous learning battle:
The generator tries to create increasingly convincing fake images
The discriminator tries to become better at detecting fake images
2.2 Detailed Architecture Breakdown
Generator Network
The generator transforms random noise into image-like structures:
Input: 128-dimensional random noise vector
Architecture:
Dense layer expands noise to 7x7x128 feature map
Two upsampling blocks double the image resolution
Uses Conv2D layers to learn features
LeakyReLU activations prevent dead neurons
Final Conv2D layer produces single-channel image
Sigmoid activation constrains output to 0-1 range

Discriminator Network
The discriminator classifies images as real or fake:
Input: 28x28x1 images
Architecture:
Multiple convolutional blocks with:
Increasing filter depths (32 → 64 → 128 → 256)
LeakyReLU activations
Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
Flattens features
Dense layer with sigmoid activation outputs probability of image being real
2.3 Training Methodology
The training process involves a minimax game:
Discriminator is trained to:
Correctly identify real images
Correctly identify generated (fake) images
Generator is trained to:
Produce images that fool the discriminator
Minimize the discriminator's ability to distinguish fake from real
3. Detailed Code Analysis
3.1 Dependencies and Data Loading
python
Copy
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
tensorflow: Deep learning framework
tensorflow_datasets: Simplifies dataset loading
numpy: Numerical computing
matplotlib: Visualization
3.2 Data Preprocessing
python
Copy
def scale_images(data): 
    image = data['image']
    return image / 255
Normalizes pixel values from 0-255 to 0-1
Helps neural network converge faster
Ensures consistent input range
3.3 Dataset Preparation
python
Copy
ds = tfds.load('fashion_mnist', split='train')
ds = ds.map(scale_images)
ds = ds.cache().shuffle(60000).batch(128).prefetch(64)
Preprocessing steps:
cache(): Store dataset in memory for faster access
shuffle(): Randomize data to prevent learning order
batch(128): Process 128 images simultaneously
prefetch(64): Prepare next batches in advance
3.4 Network Construction
The build_generator() and build_discriminator() functions create complex neural architectures using Keras Sequential API.
Import Statements:
python
Copy
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, Reshape, Dense, Flatten, LeakyReLU, Dropout, UpSampling2D
These lines import necessary components from TensorFlow's Keras API
Sequential() allows you to create a linear stack of layers
Imported layers include:
Dense: Fully connected neural network layer
Reshape: Restructures the tensor to a different shape
LeakyReLU: Activation function that allows a small gradient when the unit is not active
Other layers (Conv2D, Flatten, Dropout, UpSampling2D) are imported but not used in this specific model
Generator Function Definition:
python
Copy
def build_generator1():
  model = Sequential()
Creates a function to build the generator model
Initializes a sequential model, which means layers will be added one after another in order
First Layer - Dense Layer:
python
Copy
model.add(Dense(7*7*128, input_dim=128))
Adds a fully connected (dense) layer
Output size is 77128 = 6,272 neurons
input_dim=128 specifies the input is a 128-dimensional vector (likely a noise vector)
This layer transforms the input noise into a larger representation
Activation Function:
python
Copy
model.add(LeakyReLU(0.2))
Adds a Leaky ReLU activation function
0.2 is the slope for negative values
Helps prevent "dying ReLU" problem by allowing small gradients for negative inputs
Introduces non-linearity to the model
Reshaping Layer:
python
Copy
model.add(Reshape((7,7,128)))
Reshapes the previous layer's output into a 7x7 grid with 128 channels
Prepares the data for further processing, typically in generative models like GANs
Converts the 1D vector into a 3D tensor resembling an image feature map
Return and Test:
python
Copy
return model

test_model1 = build_generator1()
test_model1.summary()
Returns the constructed model
Creates an instance of the model
summary() displays model architecture details
Model Summary Breakdown:
Total Parameters: 809,088 (3.09 MB)

Input: 128-dimensional vector
Output: 6,272 neurons
Params: 809,088 (128 * 6,272 + bias)

Notes:
This appears to be an initial/test version of a generator for a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
The model is incomplete and would need additional layers for a full generator
Typically, you'd add more layers like transposed convolutions or upsampling to generate images
Potential Next Steps:
Add more layers for image generation
Include dropout for regularization

Uses the previously created generator model to generate images
np.random.normal() creates random noise input
Generates 4 samples

.predict() method passes the noise through the generator to create images
Shape Checking:

Subplot Setup:
python
Copy
fig, ax = plt.subplots(ncols=4, figsize=(20,20))

ax will be an array of 4 subplot axes
Image Visualization Loop:
python
Copy
for idx, img in enumerate(img):
  ax[idx].imshow(np.squeeze(img))
  ax[idx].title.set_text(idx)
Iterates through the 4 generated images
np.squeeze() removes single-dimensional entries
Converts (28,28,1) to (28,28)
imshow() displays the image
Sets the title of each subplot to its index
Key Points:
Generates 4 random images using the trained generator
Uses random noise as input

Potential Next Steps:

Normalize image display
Add more detailed labeling
Generate images with specific characteristics
Visualization Tips:
